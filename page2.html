    <h1> What psychology has to do with...everything </h1>
  <h2> Human Interaction </h2>
    <p> Psychology deals with the factors that lead us to behave in a given way in the presence of others, 
      and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur.
      This has to do with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors,
      in turn, influence our interactions with others. </p>

  <h2 class="class"> What are marijuana's long-term effects on the brain? </h2>
    <p>Several studies, including two large longitudinal studies, 
      suggest that marijuana use can cause functional impairment in cognitive abilities but that the degree 
      and/or duration of the impairment depends on the age when an individual began using, how much they used, and how long they used.
    </p>
  
  <h2 class="class"> Who can benefit the most </h2>
    <p> People with more serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, eating disorders, severe drug and alcohol addiction, 
      or manic depression.
