    <h1> What psychology has to do with...everything </h1>
  <h2> Human Interaction </h2>
    <p> Psychology deals with the factors that lead us to behave in a given way in the presence of others, 
      and look at the conditions under which certain behavior/actions and feelings occur.
      This has to do with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions and goals are constructed and how such psychological factors,
      in turn, influence our interactions with others. </p>

  <h2 class="class"> What are marijuana's long-term effects on the brain? </h2>
    <p>Several studies, including two large longitudinal studies, 
      suggest that marijuana use can cause functional impairment in cognitive abilities but that the degree 
      and/or duration of the impairment depends on the age when an individual began using, how much they used, and how long they used.

  <h2 class="class"> Who can benefit the most </h2>
    <p> People with more serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, eating disorders, severe drug and alcohol addiction, 
      or manic depression.

  <h2 class="class"> How your body reacts </h2>
    <p> Your body responds to the way you think, feel, and act. This is one type of “mind/body connection.” 
      When you are stressed, anxious, or upset, your body reacts in a way that might tell you that something isn’t right. For example, high blood pressure or a stomach ulcer might develop after a particularly stressful event, such as the death of a loved one. 
      The following can be physical signs that your emotional health is out of balance:
       -Body Pain
       -Headaches
       -Sleepiness
       -Lack of Sleep
       -High Blood Pressure
  </p>
  <h2 class="class"> Emotions <h2>
    <p> Psychology is practically the study of emotions and peoples reaction to those emotions.
      But, many things can affect exactly how we feel and how our emotions fluctuate. And the way that, seeing something bad/sad/good/happy can effect our outlook for an entire day.</p>
